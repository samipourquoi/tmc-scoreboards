# TMC Scoreboards
Display scoreboards from cool technical minecraft servers.

Built with React and Haskell (for no fucking reason honestly).

# Build
To compile the frontend, you will need Node with NPM, and the Haskell Platform.

Then, run:
```shell-script
$ make
$ # or create a Docker image...
$ make docker
```

Start the server with:
```shell-script
$ stack exec server
```

# Credits
Thanks Daniel Bauwens for the idea, and server owners for providing me their stats.
